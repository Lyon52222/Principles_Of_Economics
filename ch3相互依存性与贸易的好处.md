# ch3 相互依存性与贸易的好处
Interdependence and the Gains from Trade
- 绝对优势：用比另一个生产者更少的投入生产某种物品的能力。 
Absolute advantage:  the ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer
- 比较优势：一个生产者以低于另一个生产者的机会成本生产一种物品的能力。
Comparative advantage:  the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer
- 出口品：在国内生产而在国外销售的物品
Exports:  goods produced domestically and sold abroad
- 进口品：在国外生产而在国内销售的物品
Imports: goods produced abroad and sold domestically
- 相互依存和贸易可以使每个人都可以享有更多数量和品种的物品与劳务。 
Interdependence and trade allow everyone to enjoy a greater quantity and variety of goods & services.
- 当人们（或国家之间）能专门生产他们具有比较优势的产品时，经济“蛋糕”会变大，通过贸易也可以使每个人的状况变得更好。
When people—or countries—specialize in the goods in which they have a comparative advantage, the economic “pie” grows and trade can make everyone better off.
